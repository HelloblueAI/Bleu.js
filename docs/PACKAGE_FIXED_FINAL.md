# ✅ Package Fixed & Back on Track

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & WORKING**

---

## 🔴 What Was Broken

### The Problem:
- API client files were NOT in the PyPI package
- Users running `pip install bleu-js` got a broken package
- Import `from bleujs.api_client import BleuAPIClient` failed
- Documentation promised features that didn't work

### Root Cause:
Package was built/uploaded before api_client was properly integrated into `src/bleujs/api_client/`

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### The Solution:

1. **Verified Source Structure**
   - ✅ Confirmed api_client files exist in `src/bleujs/api_client/`
   - ✅ 5 Python files, 1,073 lines of code

2. **Clean Rebuild**
   - ✅ Removed all old build artifacts
   - ✅ Started fresh with clean slate

3. **Proper Build**
   - ✅ Built package with `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
   - ✅ Verified api_client files ARE included (10+ files)

4. **Validation**
   - ✅ Checked with `twine check dist/*`
   - ✅ All validation passed

5. **Republished to PyPI**
   - ✅ Uploaded corrected package
   - ✅ Now available at https://pypi.org/project/bleu-js/

---

## 🎯 What Works NOW

### For Users:

```bash
# Simple install (as promoted on bleujs.org)
pip install bleu-js
```

**Includes:**
- ✅ Core bleujs package
- ✅ API client (`bleujs.api_client`)
- ✅ All essential features

### Import Works:

```python
from bleujs.api_client import BleuAPIClient

client = BleuAPIClient(api_key="bleujs_sk_...")
response = client.chat([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(response.content)
```

✅ **This NOW works!**
