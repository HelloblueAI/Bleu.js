# ECDSA Vulnerability Note - Issue #295

## Status: ✅ Resolved

### Vulnerability
- **Issue:** Minerva timing attack on P-256 in python-ecdsa
- **Severity:** High
- **GitHub Issue:** #295

### Resolution

**Action Taken:** Removed `ecdsa` dependency from `pyproject.toml`

**Reason:**
- `ecdsa` is not used anywhere in the source code (`src/` directory)
- The maintainers have stated that side-channel attacks (including this timing attack) are outside the scope of the project
- No fixed version (0.20.0) is planned or available
- The `cryptography` library (already a dependency) can handle all ECDSA operations securely

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates the vulnerability completely
- ✅ Reduces dependencies
- ✅ No functionality lost (ecdsa was not used)
- ✅ Uses secure `cryptography` library for any future ECDSA needs

### Verification

```bash
# Verify ecdsa is not used in source code
grep -r "import ecdsa\|from ecdsa" src/
# Result: No matches found

# Verify ecdsa is removed from dependencies
grep "ecdsa" pyproject.toml
# Result: Only comment explaining removal
```

### Alternative

If ECDSA operations are needed in the future, use the `cryptography` library which provides secure, constant-time implementations:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

# Example: Generate ECDSA key pair
private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1(), default_backend())
public_key = private_key.public_key()
```
