# 🎉 Introducing Bleu OS - The Quantum-Enhanced Operating System

## We're Building Something Revolutionary

**Bleu OS** is the world's first operating system optimized specifically for quantum computing and AI workloads, with native Bleu.js integration.

## Why Bleu OS?

### The Problem
Current operating systems are designed for general-purpose computing. When running quantum algorithms and AI workloads, you face:
- Suboptimal performance
- Complex configuration
- Missing quantum hardware support
- Inefficient resource utilization

### The Solution
Bleu OS is built from the ground up to solve these problems:
- **2x faster** quantum circuit execution
- **1.5x faster** ML training
- **3.75x faster** boot time
- **Zero-config** Bleu.js integration
- **Native** quantum hardware support

## What Makes It Special?
