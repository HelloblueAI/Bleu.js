# 🚀 Correct GitHub Assets Upload Instructions

## The Issue
The GitHub assets link shows 404 because the assets folder doesn't exist yet. GitHub creates assets folders when you first upload files to them.

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to your repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/HelloblueAI/Bleu.js

2. **Create a new issue to upload the GIF:**
   - Click "Issues" tab
   - Click "New issue"
   - Drag and drop `terminal-demo.gif` into the text area
   - GitHub will automatically upload it and give you a URL
   - Copy the URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/HelloblueAI/Bleu.js/assets/XXXXX/terminal-demo.gif`)

3. **Update the README:**
   - Go to README.md
   - Click the pencil icon to edit
   - Replace the current GIF link with the new URL
   - Commit the changes

### Method 2: Direct Repository Upload

   ```

   - Drag and drop `terminal-demo.gif`
   - Add commit message: "Add terminal demo GIF"
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **The GIF will be available at:**
   ```
   https://github.com/HelloblueAI/Bleu.js/blob/main/terminal-demo.gif
   ```

### Method 3: Using GitHub CLI
