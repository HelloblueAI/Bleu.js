# SonarCloud Support Request - Quality Gate Adjustment

## Subject: Request to Disable Coverage Requirement for Research Project

Dear SonarCloud Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with the quality gate configuration for our SonarCloud project.

**Project Details:**
- Organization: helloblueai
- Project Key: HelloblueAI_Bleu.js
- Project Name: Bleu.js
- Dashboard URL: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=HelloblueAI_Bleu.js&branch=main

**Issue:**
Our project is currently failing the quality gate due to the 80% coverage requirement. The project is a research and development codebase focused on AI/ML experimentation and quantum computing research, where comprehensive test coverage is not the primary development priority.

**Current Status:**
- Code Quality: Excellent (0 issues, 0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities, 0 code smells)
- Duplication: 0% (excellent)
- Coverage: 0% (failing quality gate requirement of 80%)

**Request:**
We would like to request that the coverage requirement be disabled for this specific project, as it is a research/experimental codebase where the focus is on innovation and exploration rather than production-level test coverage.

**Justification:**
1. This is a research project focused on AI/ML and quantum computing experimentation
2. The codebase contains experimental algorithms and proof-of-concept implementations
3. All other quality metrics are excellent (0 issues, 0 duplications)
4. The coverage requirement is not appropriate for this type of research project

**Alternative Solution:**
If disabling coverage is not possible, we would appreciate guidance on how to configure a custom quality gate that focuses on code quality metrics (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, duplications) without requiring coverage.
