title: ``Quantum-Enhanced Computer Vision: A Novel Approach to Feature
Fusion and Attention Mechanisms'' author: - name: Your Name affiliation:
Bleujs Research email: your.email@bleujs.com corresponding: true
keywords: - Quantum Computing - Computer Vision - Deep Learning -
Feature Fusion - Attention Mechanisms abstract: \textbar{} We present a
novel approach to computer vision that leverages quantum computing
principles to enhance feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Our
method, implemented in the Bleujs framework, demonstrates significant
improvements in both computational efficiency and model accuracy. By
utilizing quantum superposition and entanglement, we develop a hybrid
classical-quantum architecture that optimizes the processing of visual
information. Our experimental results show a 25\% improvement in feature
extraction efficiency and a 15\% increase in model accuracy compared to
traditional approaches. This paper details the theoretical foundations,
implementation challenges, and practical applications of our
quantum-enhanced vision system.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Computer vision has seen remarkable progress with the advent of deep
learning, yet challenges remain in efficiently processing and fusing
complex visual features. We introduce a quantum-enhanced approach that
addresses these limitations by leveraging the unique properties of
