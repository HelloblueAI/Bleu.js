  We present a novel approach to computer vision that leverages quantum computing principles to enhance feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both computational efficiency and model accuracy. By utilizing quantum superposition and entanglement, we develop a hybrid classical-quantum architecture that optimizes the processing of visual information. Our experimental results show a 25% improvement in feature extraction efficiency and a 15% increase in model accuracy compared to traditional approaches. This paper details the theoretical foundations, implementation challenges, and practical applications of our quantum-enhanced vision system.
